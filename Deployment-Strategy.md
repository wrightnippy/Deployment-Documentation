Git tags are powerful features that allows to make specific changes in project's Development and Deployment Cycle.
They provide a way to create significant milestones,such as releases or important commits, and make it easier to re-
ference those points later. 
Branches are used for ongoing develpoment and allow for parallel worksteams .Branches facilate ongoing collaboration
ans code evaluation.
Git tags can help in managing and tracking deployments by Marking release versions : Tags are commonly use d to mark specific versions 
of the codebase that correspond to deployments. By create atag by each release and deployment milestone ,you can easily identify and
reference the the exact codeb that was deployed.
Ensuring reproducibility : when depolyig software ,it's curial to ensure that the same code version is used consistently across different
environments. By tagging releases you establish a clear reference point for each development
Rollbacks and Hotfixes : In a case a deployed version encounters issues or bugs ,having tagged releases allows to quickly revert to a 
satble version.
Documentation and Communication : Tags serves as documentation points that include significant releases or deployments.
Integration with CI/CD pipelines: Git tags can be integrated into continous integration and continous Deployments CI/CD pipelines.
By leveraging Git tags ,you can establish a reliable and organized system for managing and tracking deployments ,ensuring version control,
reproducibility,and effecientrollback mechanisms.
To ensure that the client's production environment remains unaffeted by ongoing development my team can take the following steps;
Established a seperate development environment .Set up a dedicated development environment that is isolated from the production environment.
Implement Version Control: use a rebust version control system such as git to manage your code base . This ensures that changes made during
develpoment are properly traced ,and it allows you to rollback to previous versions if needed.
Adapt a branching strategy : Utilize abranching strategy such as git flow to keep development work seperate from the main production branch.
Implement automated testing : Setup acomprehensive suite for automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests.
Continous Integraation and Deployment : Implement a continous integration (CI) and continous deployment pipeline .This allows for automated 
building testing and depolyment of code changes to the development environment .
Staging Environment :create a staging environment the closely resembles the production environment .This environment should be use for final
testing of new feartures and changes before they are deployed to the live system.
Change Management Process: Established a well defined change management process that includes proper documentation, code reviews and approvals before deploying 
changes to the production environment .
Backup and rollback procedures : Implement regular backups of the production environment to minimize the impact of any unforseen issues .
Monitor and Log : Set up comprehensive monitoring and logging systems in the production environment .This enables you to proactively identify issues, track
system performance, any repond quickly to any anomalies or errors.
Communication and Coordination : Maintain open and transparent commmunication with the client throughout the development process .Keep the informed about thre process,
any potential risks ,and deployment schelude.
